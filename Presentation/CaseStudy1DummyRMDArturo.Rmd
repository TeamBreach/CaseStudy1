## R Markdown Dummy

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

Simple Plot

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE}
plot(ABV~IBU, data=AllBeer)
abline(lm(ABV~IBU, data=AllBeer))
```


Simple Plot

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(dat=AllBeer, aes(x=IBU, y=ABV)) + 
  geom_point(shape=16) + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm) + theme_minimal() 
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
